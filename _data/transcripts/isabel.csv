,Yahaira,": I will have you introduce yourself, tell me a little about you.",
,Isabel,": I'm in ninth grade and my favorite subjects I guess are math, social Studies and I like to do dance in my free time.",
,Yahaira,": So you're in ninth grade, how long have you been at CA?",
,Isabel,: This is my first year.,
,Yahaira,: Were you at a private school before?,
,Isabel,": Yeah I went to a private Catholic school where most of the things we learned were bilingual, in Spanish and English.",
,Yahaira,: You were there from...?,
,Isabel,: Second grade to eighth grade,
,Yahaira,: Where did you attend before?,
,Isabel,: I attended a school in Lakewood.,
,Yahaira,: Is it public or private?,
,Isabel,: Public,
,Yahaira,: Did you decide to transition into private school or did your parents?,in
,Isabel,": My mom decided that because my kindergarten teacher talked to her. I was an advanced student and she said that I would function better, because my issue was I used to distract the other kids because I would get bored or I would understand the concept well and my mom really tried to get me into private school after that.",in;exp
,Yahaira,": So what made them choose that specific school, a bilingual private school?",
,Isabel,": My mom, ever since I was little, she always wanted to teach me Spanish and like really engrave Spanish in my head, because my parents always thought we were gonna be here like temporarily. So like my name they wrote with the purpose of it being pronounceable in Spanish and also like they really wanted to teach me Spanish and like get a head start.",exp
,Yahaira,": You said you wouldn't be here long term, where did they expect to go?",
,Isabel,": What they expected to do was basically to save up money, have my dad work here and then later on move back to MÃ©xico, and build their own house and stuff like that.",
,Yahaira,: What made that change?,
,Isabel,": I'm not sure, I feel like my parents realized that their jobs provided more here than if they just saved up and went back to their old life.",
,Yahaira,: What made you choose CA?,
,Isabel,": When I was in sixth grade, I came to HOPE. I had like a tour around the school and a lot of the HOPE high schoolers were really nice and like it became my dream school. So it was like a goal I had set up for myself for high school.",exp;motiv
,Yahaira,: Do you like it here so far?,exp
,Isabel,": It's been challenging. It has definitely been a transition, especially the people I surround myself with. There is more, I guess white people here, in my old school it was just pure Hispanic kids and like one or two white kids, and now I feel like it's the reverse.",exp;in
,Yahaira,: Do you ever feel isolated?,exp
,Isabel,: I do sometimes.,exp
,Yahaira,": If you were to choose again, like if you could go back to just a year ago, would you choose to come here again?",
,Isabel,": That is something I've been debating recently. I've been thinking like ""Did I make the correct choice?"" Because I feel like I'm not myself anymore because if I were to compare myself now to last year I would say last year I was an excelling student. I was really advanced. I was really studious and I knew what I wanted, but right now I'm really confused and like spread out. I've been struggling in certain classes that I usually never struggled in.",exp
,Yahaira,": Do you feel like that's partly because of the environment that you're in and having to get used to something else on top of the fact that you know you're taking pretty demanding courses even as a ninth grader? It's a private school, it's a college preparatory school, so on top of all the academics and sports and arts and stuff, you still have to deal with the outside social aspect?",
,Isabel,": I feel like that definitely contributed to that. Like my confidence, I will say it really decreased, because I was very shy and I was scared. I would easily get embarrassed from doing simple things like walking in the halls, I was very self conscious about myself.",exp;belo
,Yahaira,: Are you still considering leaving or are you gonna be here next year?,
,Isabel,": Sometimes when I'm in low moments I'm like ""I shouldn't be here. This is not my school."" But I feel like in the long run it's definitely worth it because I've heard really good things about the College Counseling Office and like the programs we have here that really do help for the future.",exp;belo;suppin
,Yahaira,: So it's more of like you're sticking it through so that you get something out of it later on?,
,Isabel,: Yes.,
,Yahaira,": I know you've only been here for a year, but what have been some of the highlights you could say are from being here? What are some of the good things that have happened?",
,Isabel,": The teams, especially during sports, like how everyone's very supportive of each other and how everyone's really inclusive. I thought it was gonna be more hostile, especially at the beginning of the year. I thought people were gonna be really close to each other since many of them are coming from middle school. But many of them were very accepting. I also liked how the teachers really motivate you and like if you have personal issues they work with you, cooperate with you, and stuff like that.",suppin;exp
,Yahaira,": Conversely, what would you say are some of the obstacles that you have faced? I think this is an interesting question for you because you're coming from a private school, a private school that's different from this private school. So what are some of the things you've experienced here at CA that you didn't experience at your old school?",
,Isabel,": Something that I really faced was the social aspect. I'm a very social person in general, I'm very outspoken, opinionated. But I feel like my first day, that really changed. I struggled to find my group of friends, I tried to hang out with many people, but I felt like they just weren't getting to know me and many of them had first impressions that weren't accurate with who I am.",exp;in
,Yahaira,: Who was your first friend coming here?,
,Isabel,": I think Josefina because like even though she came from a public school and I came from a private school we had similar experiences, where we were like really excelling students in our old schools and we both feel like we're not excelling students anymore and we're struggling in certain materials and we're kind of like upset because we weren't really prepared for this.",
,Yahaira,: When you say you weren't prepared for it do you mean like the academics or like you kind of felt like you had this expectation of CA but once you got here it was a little different.,in
,Isabel,": I think it was both because I thought I was gonna do pretty good in academics because it's something I really stood out in and also the social aspect I was like ""Oh, everyone's going to be so friendly"" things like that but as time went on my reality kind of hit that it wasn't going to be like that.",in;belo
,Yahaira,": What are some of the things that made you think, ""This is not what I expected""?",
,Isabel,": I would say not having similar things to relate to with a lot of people. Especially economical background. I am not like other people that take four vacations a year, I've never traveled outside of the country, I don't go to country clubs or big parties, or stuff like that.",reps;exp;eff
,Yahaira,: How does that make you feel?,
,Isabel,": Sometimes it's frustrating because I feel like I have to work harder or the expectations for me are higher in general, in school and outside of school. Like I have to prove myself because I don't have that guarantee that I'm good enough to do certain things.",respo
,Yahaira,: Do you compare yourself a lot to the people around you?,
,Isabel,: Yeah.,
,Speaker q:,: Do you wish you didn't?,
,Isabel,": I've always had this issue where I would always compare myself to other people, like what clothes they were wearing, what sports they do, and I feel like that has definitely increased here. I feel like that has also affected my confidence levels. I'm constantly comparing myself like, ""Ugh, I don't do lacrosse or I'm not on Varsity. I need to be better or like find something that I stand out in"", and that's definitely been very stressful. And I feel like I have to work really hard or try to find a way to stick out or look good for college and stuff.",comp;respo
,Yahaira,: Are you trying to prove yourself not only to others but to yourself that you deserve to be here?,exp;belo
,Isabel,: Yeah definitely.,exp;belo
,Yahaira,: Is it like trying to convince yourself that you have a place here?,exp;belo
,Isabel,: Yeah,exp;belo
,Yahaira,: What is something about CA that you would change?,
,Isabel,: I'm not sure there's like a lot of issues I have but I don't have solutions to them.,
,Yahaira,": You don't have to. This is not a space where you need to. Just tell me what your problems are, not how you would fix them but what you would fix.",
,Isabel,": First of all, the flex days where we try to reintegrate everyone. I feel it's very forceful, I feel we need to find ways to make it more natural for kids to talk to each other. Some town hall meetings about informational stuff like your wellbeing and eating disorders and all that, I feel it's not very functional like it doesn't really do much. I feel just putting out more resources for kids to reach out on their own would probably help. *I feel like [CA] is kind of performative. I even fell for that coming in, I thought I was going to be very included, everyone's so nice and kind, but I've definitely faced some microaggressions that some white people have said and they just don't realize how ignorant they sound. I feel like that's the main issue, like a lot of people that are privileged are ignorant and I feel like we need to include more educational stuff in the curriculums.",exp;belo;in
,Yahaira,: What are some of the microaggressions you have experienced?,
,Isabel,": Me and Josefina the other day, we were dancing and I've been trying to get better for my quinceaÃ±era and so we were dancing and we asked one of our classmates to record us and obviously I am not the best and I admit it but she was like, ""Oh your dancing looks like dancing like chickens"" and stuff like that. In French, I feel my teacher doesn't mean to say it but it feels targeting because she's like, ""Oh for my Mexican ladies this is a very similar cognate"" or something like that and I feel like she really targets me and Josefina for having Spanish as a language background",
,Yahaira,: Did you ever experience a microaggression before CA?,
,Isabel,": No, not really.",
,Yahaira,": How did that make you feel, the first time that it happened?",
,Isabel,": It definitely shocked me and it left me surprised. Reality hit because I felt like ""Oh people don't realize this is wrong"".",
,Yahaira,: Do you feel you have a good support system here?,
,Isabel,": I feel like it's kind of there but I'm not willing to be vulnerable here. I feel like it's definitely scary because not a lot of people can relate. But my mom and my dad, they've been a good support system. My mom, we were talking about this yesterday, and she's like ""Do you want to go to another school? Do you think this is the correct decision for you?"" so I feel like at home it's good. But here, I feel like I don't have teachers I can relate to. I remember my first day seeking out teachers that I guess looked like me or had a background like me so I could relate to and get closer to.",suppin;suppout;exp;reps
,Yahaira,": I know we talked a little bit about how you're trying to stick it through because of the college process. What about the college process? Is it for you, like that's your goal you want to go to college? Or does part of it play into having immigrant parents?",motiv
,Isabel,": I feel like it's both. I've definitely seeked that goal on my own ever since I was very very young. When I was four years old, I've always liked learning, I always liked pursuing and learning more things. I was the one who told my mom ""I want to go to preschool, put me in preschool."" But I also feel like it's very pressuring because I have to get my family through.",respo;motiv
,Yahaira,: So you feel like you have almost like an extra responsibility with your family?,respo
,Isabel,: Yeah,respo
,Yahaira,: Do you have any siblings?,
,Isabel,": I do, I have younger brother",
,Yahaira,: You're the oldest then. Are there a lot of things you help your parents out with?,
,Isabel,": I do. I feel like I try to be very logical. For example, my parents are divorced so I help my mom fill my dads role and my moms role at my dads.",respo
,Yahaira,": So you have to step up and be kind of an adult, is what you're saying?",respo
,Yahaira,: Yeah.,
,Yahaira,: How does that feel?,
,Isabel,: It's kind of stressful. I feel like it's very stressful because I have to deal with school and then I also have to be a role model for my brother. And it's hard to manage because I have to look out for my own future but for my families as well and go and fight for a future for them.,respo
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like you interact with a lot of people of your race and ethnicity outside of CA?,aff;suppout
,Isabel,": I feel ever since I've gotten here it's decreased a lot. I feel like the only person I really see that keeps me connected is my friend who's my neighbor. On weekends I'll walk to her house and she'll walk to mine, or we'll go out together. But I feel like I get heavily criticized sometimes for going to private school. Some people think I'm a snob, or they're like ""Oh, private school experiences, like it could never be me, I go to a public school."" And I'm like, well it's not that easy. Yes, it has more advantages than going to just a public school, but I have to fight for my spot.",suppout
,Yahaira,: You said your mom wanted you to know Spanish from a really young age. Do you feel like you know it well?,
,Isabel,I feel like I know it well. It's not to be braggy but definitely on my first try I was very confident with my Spanish. I feel like I can replace half of these teachers in Spanish and get a paid salary. And that's something else I would like to change. They should hire teachers that are native speakers. If they're preaching such a high education get native speakers.,reps;exp
,Yahaira,"In four years, if you're here, what do you picture you will have done?",
,Isabel,"I don't know. There are a lot of things I'm very involved in. But my goal right now, with things that I'm a part of, would be like with Mock Trial. My goal right now is to be on A Team because I admire our A Team because they're really good. It involves public speaking, and I've always been insecure of public speaking. Actually, I remember my first microaggression, someone asked condescendingly* ""You speak another language right? I can like hear it in your voice"". I'm like, are you kidding me? It was my first week of ultimate frisbee.",exp
,Yahaira,Oh so it was another student?,
,Isabel,"Yeah, they were like ""You speak another language. What language do you speak?"" And I'm like, ""Oh I speak Spanish"" and they were like ""Yeah, I can tell."" They were passive aggressive.",
,Yahaira,"For me, I try not compare myself a lot to my white peers because we come from different places. We're bound to be different. But I feel like I had a very hard time not comparing myself to my POC peers. Do you ever feel that way?",comp
,Isabel,"I feel that way sometimes in the social aspect with certain people who have been here longer*. I guess since some of them have been here longer, the others have accepted them. I feel like they don't see them anymore as hispanic, because I will say they've assimilated more. And I feel like I'm struggling because I don't want to assimilate but I don't want to stick out so much and it's kind of confusing. With some of my other hispanic peers I feel like we're on the same level, and I feel more empathy towards them. I hold a lot of grudge towards my white peers, like ""If only they knew, if only they knew"".",comp;exp
,Yahaira,"You say you don't want to assimilate but you also don't want to stand out too much, can you talk a little bit more on that.",
,Isabel,"Sometimes, I feel like the way I express myself through how I dress is the way I assimilate or stand out because if I were to assimilate my friends outside of school would be like ""Oh my God, you've gotten so white washed. Like look at you you're basically a white girl!"" Or if I were to dress, I guess, more what people would call 'mexican' or 'latina' I would stick out and they'll be like ""Oh, she's definitely a Latina"". And I'm proud of who I am, it's just I don't want to just be known for being Latina.",exp;belo
,Yahaira,"To kind of come to a stopping point, just like as a big overall question: Do you feel like you belong at CA.",belo
,Isabel,No. Not like definitely. No.,belo
,Yahaira,Do you feel like that will ever change?,belo
,Isabel,Um not really. I feel like I may start being able to socialize better or kind of work my way back up to some sort of how I used to be. But I feel like it's not gonna be the same because I've been exposed to a new environment.,belo
,Yahaira,So you feel like there will always be a little part that feels like this isn't the right space for you?,belo
,Isabel,Yeah,belo
,Yahaira,"In an ideal world, what would your perfect school look like?",belo
,Isabel,"I feel like there should be more people of color, because I feel like we're just picked based off what we're gonna bring, or what type of image we're gonna bring, or what type of background we currently have that's gonna impact and make the school better. It is important for the school's image but I feel like they should save more spaces for POC. And teaching people more about cultural things and struggles.",belo;exp;aff
