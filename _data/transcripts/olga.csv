,Yahaira,: So you can start by introducing yourself. Tell me a little bit about yourself.,
,Olga,": I'm a senior at Colorado Academy, and I've been going there for only four years, since freshman year.",
,Yahaira,: And what are some things about you?,
,Olga,: I'm Mexican. I'm first generation. I'm going to the east coast* for college next year. ,
,Yahaira,: What about CA? How would you describe yourself as a student there?,
,Olga,": I do a lot of DEI work or I try to, with my other friends. I do a lot of art and stuff for CA, so I'm pretty big in the little art department, I think.",
,Yahaira,: So you said you've been at CA for four years. Where were you before that?,
,Olga,: I went to a public middle school and before that I was at a different public elementary school.*,
,Yahaira,: Were they predominantly Hispanic?,
,Olga,": Yeah. I think my middle school* was literally all just Hispanics and Mexicans, people kind of the same situation that I'm in, first generation and low income. And then my elementary school* was kind of a mix. There were a lot of Asian and Latino students. And then I think there were a couple of white people, but I don't really remember much.",exp
,Yahaira,": So when you applied to the school for the first time, what drew you to CA? Why did you apply to private school?",
,Olga,": So I had a teacher my seventh grade year, and during parent teacher conferences, she kind of brought it up to my mom that I should apply to a private school. She previously went to CA, she went there I think junior year through senior year. So she only went for two years, but she was like, ""Oh, she should at least try to apply."" And then I was also part of a summer program at another private school*. And so they were also pushing me to apply to private schools. And I kind of already got the feel for it, the private school life.  And so all I saw was positives because at that program it was only people of color. And so I was like, ""Oh, maybe this is going to be my same experience"". I never really thought about the people that were going to be there. I just thought about the opportunities and the campus. I didn't really think about the people much. I was like, ""Oh, it's a pretty campus. I don't think it's going to matter."" And so that's kind of what drew me to it.",motiv
,Yahaira,: Why did you choose CA?,
,Olga,": They gave me a bit more money or a little bit more financial aid. Also I feel like that was my end goal, CA, because my teacher had hyped it up so much. And when I went to visit the campus, I really liked the energy and stuff. And I don't know what it was, but I was just like, I feel like I should go to CA. And then they gave me a scholarship, which was different from my other option. And it basically covered my entire tuition.",motiv
,Yahaira,: So you only applied to the two private schools. You didn't apply to any other ones?,
,Yahaira,: No.,
,Yahaira,: Did you have an option outside of the two private schools if you didn't get into either?,
,Olga,": Yeah, I had other public school options lined up*.",
,Yahaira,": Now you're a senior, you're graduating in a couple of weeks, you're going to college, do you feel like you've gotten what you wanted out of CA?",
,Olga,": I feel like I did. Out of all the things that I was offered, I feel like I did most of them. I traveled abroad, which is one of the main things that I wanted to do in high school was to travel somewhere. I got into the college I wanted to. I feel like I exercised all the things that I could have. I feel like I experienced everything. I also experienced going to SDLC, which is something that not a lot of people go to. And so I feel like after that I was like, well, I'm doing something that not a lot of people at CA do. So I feel like I'm taking advantage of most of the stuff. And I get along with most of the staff. I'm involved with the administration and stuff. So I feel like I did do as much as I could have.",exp
,Yahaira,": And when you were going into your high school experience and you think back to before your freshman year and you're picturing what you wanted out of your high school experience, did you get that? Outside of academics and how involved you were?",
,Olga,": Oh, I think it is different. Academically, I feel like I got everything that I needed, but socially it was different. Socially, I thought I was going to end up with a bunch of friends or end up with a big group that I felt comfortable with. And obviously I'm grateful for all the friends I have, I feel like I'm so grateful for what I have now. But if I were to imagine the type of social life I have now, I wouldn't have believed it, I guess. I was so outgoing, middle school and stuff, and I am still pretty outgoing, but compared to how I was in middle school with all my Latino friends, it's not the same.",exp
,Yahaira,: What is different about it?,
,Olga,": There's no POC. There's no one who really relates to the same things that I do or that I experience, I guess. And there's only so many people that actually understand what it's like to be a POC at CA or acknowledge it. That's not to say that I'm not friends with white people, but it's a different dynamic. It's not like I'm best friends with a white peer. It's like I'm friends with them, but it's not as close as friendships I have with other POC's.",aff;exp
,Yahaira,": When you transitioned into CA, was it hard?",in
,Olga,": Yes. It was so hard. I feel like academically it was hard because in middle school I didn't really try. I just did my work, and that's what kind of got me through. And at CA it was kind of like, you have to study, you have to do this. There's tests, there's exams, there's assignments that you have to do outside of school hours, which was different from middle school. And also socially, it was horrible. It was during Covid, I only met half of my class, and it was just hard to even talk to people. Everyone already had their friend groups and stuff, and it was hard to even just introduce myself to others. It was like, how are they going to perceive me? And it is such a small school too, so it's like if I made a mistake or something, I feel like it was going to be difficult for me to come back from that.",in;belo
,Yahaira,": If given the option, again, knowing everything that you know now, and you were put back to before freshman year and you had the choice to go to CA again, would you go?",
,Olga,": I feel like that's difficult because I'm so grateful for the people that I have in my life now that I wouldn't change it. I wouldn't change the experiences that I've been given. I think it's just hard when you try to only think about the negatives. If I think about all the microaggressions and stuff that I've experienced, I would say I would choose another school. But it's like I've met so many people that have changed me for the better, that have made my CA experience worth it, so I feel like I wouldn't change it. I wouldn't go back. I think I would still choose CA, even though it was a difficult time, I still have a lot of good memories attached to it, I think. So I don't think I would change it.",exp
,Yahaira,": If I would've asked you this question two years ago, would it be the same answer?",exp
,Olga,": No. I would've definitely said no. Two years ago, I 100% wanted to transfer. I wanted to go to either a school with my friends outside of CA, or just anywhere that wasn't like CA at all. It was very difficult to even get adjusted to it, and I feel like it was so easy to just give up and to continue going here. Two years ago, I would've never said that I was content with my experience at CA, but I think now as a senior wrapping things up, it's just easier to be like, it was good. Which is crazy. ",exp;out
,Yahaira,": So you considered leaving, why didn't you?",
,Olga,": I think I just talked to my mom a lot about it, and she was like, ""At the end of the day, you're not there to make friends, you're there to study."" I think that stuck with me a lot, and that's probably part of the reason why I didn't move. I was like, I'm given this opportunity, why am I not going to use it? There's people who want to be in my position and they're not. And it's like, why would I? Just to make it easier for myself? Why would I do that? And overall, my end goal was to go to college, go to a good college that I wouldn't have been able to get into if I went to a different school. And so I just had to tough it out, honestly. I just had to choose one or the other. Did I want to have a future or did I want to have a good high school experience? And I was like, guess I'll have the future.",motiv;exp
,Yahaira,: Did it feel like you were almost trying to convince yourself that CA was the only place you could be at to get a future? You couldn't have a future elsewhere?,
,Olga,": I kind of did. I feel like that was the main reason why I wanted to go in the first place. That's the only reason why my parents wanted me to go to a private school was because they kind of guaranteed that I was going to go to college. If this is the only good thing that I'm experiencing right now, this is the only thing that is really benefiting me, why would I give it up? So I kind of convinced myself, this is why I'm going to CA. And at the time, that's the only benefit I saw, was that I'm going to have a future. Obviously I would have a feature somewhere else if I put my mind to it, but it wouldn't be as easy. I wouldn't have that prestigious name next to mine, I think. And that's what made it for me. I was like, I know I'm having a shitty experience right now, but it's different once you have a name next to it.",motiv
,Yahaira,": So when you decided to go to private school and decided to stay in private school, do you feel like it was mainly your decision and a little bit of your parents' influence? Or how much was it split? Who had the most influence in that decision?",
,Olga,": I mean, at the end of the day, it was my decision. My mom never forced me to stay at CA. She always said, ""It was your decision to come here. It was never mine."" And I kind of agree with that. I guess it was my decision to even apply. So, at the end of the day, it was mine. But my parents also, just thinking about how hard they've been working and being first generation in my family to go to college and stuff, it was my decision but at the same time, it was very influenced by how we lived. And it wasn't necessarily what my parents said, but it was more like what I had seen them do that had made me be like, ""Oh, let me stay. It's better for me to feel like I've accomplished something than to have a social life or a better high school experience"".",motiv;respo
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like a better social life would've made your high school experience better?,
,Olga,": Probably. I feel like it would probably have been less challenging to put myself out there, be my authentic self. I feel like I code switch a lot, and so I feel like a better social life would've at least given me somewhere to feel comfortable in. Even though there were places that I was comfortable in at CA, but it wouldn't have been the same. I need to talk to people. I need to at least have someone to talk to or something. I feel like that would've helped a little bit in even transitioning into CA. Let's say there was a higher population of POC at the private school, it would've been easier to go through the academic stuff and would have made the academic difference between middle school and high school a little easier. I would've had someone to talk to about it.",exp;aff;in;suppin
,Yahaira,: Do you have anyone to talk to right now?,
,Olga,": Yeah, now I have a bunch of people to talk to. After freshman year, everything kind of expanded from there with the POD and stuff. I gained a lot of friendships and I gained stronger connections to people that I had already been kind of friends with. I feel supported now. But it wasn't like that before.",belo;aff
,Yahaira,: What do you think made that now? Why wasn't it like that before? What transition did you make or happened that made you become closer to other people?,
,Olga,": I think mainly it was the POD. I feel like that's what kind of brought me together. I had a different mindset before like, ""Oh, I'm just going to go to school. I'm not going to make friends. It's fine, whatever."" Which changed to, ""Okay, let me try a little. Let me actually try to socialize with people."" And also I think just being vulnerable with the people that I was around, that I already had around me, made it easier. It made me have those deeper connections. And even going, it's weird, even going through the microaggressions kind of made me closer to people that I had, because it was like ""Oh damn, we're really going through this together."" So it's like, okay, if we're both going through it together, I'm not alone. I feel like it's like a similar but weaker version of trauma bonding. But stuff like that, it's a little bit of a bond. We went through it together, so now we have this stronger bond.",belo;aff;suppin
,Yahaira,": How do you feel now, with this year the POD not being a thing anymore?",
,Olga,": It's made me realize how people really are. I feel like in the POD, I kind of surrounded myself with people that I wanted to be around. I always had people that I was comfortable with and stuff like that. But without the POD there, I have to be in the lounge, I have to be around these people that I've never really been around before. Sophomore year, immediately we got introduced to the POD, even freshman year we got introduced to the POD, but sophomore year was the year that we were actually at school in person. And so even there, I was always in the POD, always with POC. And it's like now senior year, it's like, ""Damn, now I have to be around these white people that I've never really been around before."" Obviously I've been in lounges before, but now it's like I'm there all the time. Whereas before I was surrounding myself with people that I actually enjoyed being around, and now I actually have to see the dumb stuff that people say. So it's hard.",belo;exp;suppin;aff
,Yahaira,: What are some of the things that you had to experience?,
,Olga,": Most of it is being compared to someone else that I'm not. And also I've heard talk about immigration, like people being either very anti-immigrant or stuff like that. A lot of things happen in US history, I got exposed to a lot sophomore year. A lot of it has also just been like, getting called the wrong name, getting my name mispronounced, being scared to even say my name. Sometimes when substitutes come, it's just like, ""Dang, please get it right on the first try. Or at least try to say it in a Spanish accent or something."" Even just dumbing down my name to being something that's easier for white people to pronounce. Which has been something that I've been impacted by. I remember the first time my parents heard the dumb way to pronounce it, they were like, ""Who the hell is that?"" And I was like, ""It's actually me"". It's funny, because now I feel like it's so common for me to use the other version of my name, instead of the way it should be pronounced. Even at work, somewhere that's not even related to school, I use the other version.",exp
,Yahaira,: Do you think in college that'll change?,
,Olga,": I don't know. I feel like it depends on who I'm around, I'd probably used both versions. It doesn't bother me as much as it used to. I remember sophomore year, it really bothered me that I had to change my name a little bit to accommodate. Maybe I'll interchange 'em like I do now, a little bit. What else? What other microaggressions have I experienced? I'm trying to think. It's just like I've blocked out so much that I don't remember.",exp
,Yahaira,": Yeah, that's fair.",
,Olga,": I remember one time, I was on a call with a peer and they were talking about some type of meat or something. And I thought, what the hell? Why am I on FaceTime with this kid? But it was for a project for history or something. And they were talking about some type of pork. They would mimic its name in a stereotypical accent, and called the meat, ""Something Mexican."" Then they pointed me out and were like, ""Well, you should know, right?"" It wasn't even a type of meat, it was like a meal. It was pupusas, which is not a Mexican dish. Stuff like that. It's just like, why are you saying it? Why are you being the way that you are? Or even them just being like, ""Oh, that one.""",exp
,Yahaira,": Like distinguishing you from the other Mexican girl in your grade by calling either one of you ""that one"". Like they didn't bother to learn either of your names.",exp
,Olga,": Yeah they would say, ""Which one is that one?"" I feel like most of it has just been getting confused for someone else. Or even when the topic of race or immigration comes up, it's like everyone looks at you and it's just like, chill. I never really immigrated, it was my parents. I don't know if this is considered a microaggression, but I feel like freshman year everyone kind of just assumed that I spoke Spanish, even though I never spoke, at all. I never spoke a word freshman year. I remember one time someone was like, ""Can you help me with my Spanish homework?"" And I was like, but how do you know that I speak Spanish? Is it just because I'm brown or what? Stuff like that, it low key feels passive aggressive. I feel like it's the small things that people do. And then just the administration, just not caring about what people go through is what pisses me off the most. Students can say whatever, but it's like who's letting them say that? It's the administration.",exp;suppin
,Yahaira,: You said you're involved in a lot of the DEI work. Could you talk a little bit about that? When did you get involved? Why? What have you done?,
,Olga,": I feel like it probably all started with the POD, just being in there after some issues that came up. Our room was right next to one of the adults that worked at CA, as a part of the DEI team, and it kind of started there. I also saw the work being done with PlatForum, when that was the thing. And so I was kind of like, ""Well, that's kind of fun. I kind of want to be able to do that."" I had never really been a part of that type of work before, in middle school. I was never really exposed to that type of diversity and inclusion work that was happening at CA. It was kind of new to me, and so I kind of got introduced from those positions. After that, I think it was just being involved with the POD a lot and telling teachers that my experience at CA has been shit, or at least it hasn't been good. From there I just got into it and after that we went to SDLC, which I pushed to go to. I remember I emailed people to go because peers had come up to me in the POD and had talked about their experience at SDLC. I remember someone was talking about how much they loved it and it was online, so I was like, if they loved it so much online, I feel like it's going to be a good experience in person. That really motivated me to go. And I think seeing other people, older people in the grades above me, do it. It showed me that you can stand up for something else. So I think that's how I started and then it kind of spiraled from there.",respo;exp
,Yahaira,: What are some of the things you've done?,
,Olga,": Recently we've done a speech to the entire faculty and staff at CA, talking about our experience and how much it's affected us and how they can be part of a change too. I've activated for the POD and tried to bring it back after it was kind of taken down. It's not the same anymore. It's not a place for people to feel comfortable in. Those are just some examples. I feel like it's more conversations behind the scenes than actually doing something because it's harder to do something actual without having those conversations first.",respo;exp
,Yahaira,: Do you sometimes feel like too much rides on you to do things like that as a student?,
,Olga,": Yeah, I think a lot of people don't step up because they're scared of how they're going to be perceived by their white peers. Which I definitely understand because I've experienced that. I kind of wanted to fit in or I wanted to be accepted by people that I had never been around. So I understand it, but I feel like at this point it's only really three or four people doing the work. And I'm one of those four people, mostly because we're the only people who have had the guts to stand up for everyone else. So it's difficult now as a senior to see that no one's really stepping up to anything. Maybe people are doing slight work, but it's like they'll never do the same thing that we've been doing. To try to talk to the head of school or the board of trustees or stuff like that. People will just do the bare minimum just to look good in front of colleges and look good in front of their peers. I feel like a lot of things ride on me and three other people because we've been doing it for so long. So it's like now people kind of just assume, ""Oh, well they'll obviously do it."" Like the thing with the diversity day, that was not me. I feel like obviously it's something that I participated in and stuff, but it was forced upon me. It wasn't really something that I wanted to be involved in.",respo
,Yahaira,: Do you think in situations like that it's not only expected from your other peers but it's also expected from administration?,
,Olga,": Yeah, it definitely is. I feel like after SDLC, they were like, ""Oh, well you love DEI work. You want to stand up for the people, the POC in your environment."" Which I do, but it's like I am not willing to do it if no one else is willing to keep it up. What's the point of all of it? What's the point of doing all this if no one else wants it. I also thought about even making an affinity group for just Latinx people but who's going to go? Stuff like that. It's like other POC aren't really invested in those types of things more than fitting in. So there's different aspects that are just like the administration wants us to do something about it, but it's like other people aren't willing to participate. So it's like, why are you forcing me to do something that other people don't even want to do and I don't want to do? But I definitely do feel like it's mostly the administration being like, ""Well, if you want something to change, you have to do it."" And it's like duh but who the hell is supporting us? No teachers are supporting us. It is just us. And not even the administration is supporting it.",respo;suppin
,Yahaira,: What have been some of your highlights at CA and private school?,
,Olga,": I think my highlights have been mostly senior year. Going to SDLC was really fun. Also, having to do my own portfolio show was really fun. It was a cool experience to be able to show off my art and stuff in an exhibit. Global traveling, going to Panama was really fun. I think that's something that I will remember forever. And even just my experience in the college process was memorable, not fun, but memorable. It was definitely an experience that I'll remember for sure. And I think just the support from the college office and stuff has been really memorable. I think just having people that understand that I'm first generation and I need a little bit more support than other people, has been really nice. And I think that's one of the things that I like about CA is that there are a lot of staff that are really understanding, apart from just administration as a whole. There are staff that care, and I think that's something that I would probably remember.",exp;suppin
,Yahaira,: Do you feel represented at CA?,
,Olga,": No. I feel like most of the representation is for photos and just propaganda for the school website. Most of it is just like, ""Oh, look at this poor Mexican girl going to our school. This is the money you are donating to her."" So no, I feel like they're not really presenting the most authentic version of what my experience has been. I feel like the only way that they could really fully represent my experiences is by showing all the negative things about it, about how difficult it is to fit in or how difficult it is to adjust from a public school education to a private one.",resp;in;exp
,Yahaira,: Just being honest?,
,Olga,": Yeah, just being transparent about the issues that do happen at the school. Obviously, I haven't experienced the worst of it. I feel like I probably experienced less than other POC at my school. And so I feel like just being transparent about the fact that people are going to struggle to fit in, besides just being like ""Oh, CA is a really welcoming place, and we're really inclusive, and our goals are to make curious and adventurous leaders."" And that's not at all what you see once you enter CA. It is very much its own little world. People have been going there for 12 years of their life and it's like, no, you're not making curious and adventurous leaders if you only have one type of person in your entire school. I feel like my experience hasn't been shown. You're only showing the positive experiences like, yes, they have good college counseling and they have good experiences, good global travel. But that's only a couple days out of the week that I'm experiencing something good or a couple of days out of the four years that I've experienced it, and it's not the same.",belo;exp;in
,Yahaira,": Do you feel like overall you've been well served at CA? You've had everything that you needed to be successful,",
,Olga,": I guess? Let's put it in this way, if I would've gone to CA in middle school or gone pre-K through 12, I would've definitely been underserved. I feel like you wouldn't have gotten the experiences outside of private school and stuff. And I feel like the only reason why it served me well was because I experienced stuff before. If I hadn't done that, I definitely think that I would've been underserved. I feel like it served me for what I wanted, which is a career and a college path, but I feel like it underserved me in the way that they didn't give me much support when it came to my belonging at CA or making the transition easier. They kind of just threw me in and they were like, ""Oh, are you okay? Oh, that sucks. Womp womp. Move on.""",suppin;belo;in
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like the way that it served you was just as a stepping stone into what you wanted for the future?,out
,Olga,": Yeah. I feel like that's the only way it benefited me, but it didn't benefit me in the way that I was happy there. I guess it wasn't all cupcakes and rainbows. It was hard to not go to a school with people that had the same experiences as me. Even just besides race, even the social class aspect, it's like I don't have all these things that people have. People would talk about taking trips to Cabo for the week or something like that. It's like I have never even gone on a real vacation before, so it was hard to even just process that. It was crazy to me that I was going to the same school with these people that are so privileged that I will never experience some of the things that they have.",ouit;exp
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like you compare yourself often to others?,comp
,Olga,": Yeah. I feel like I struggled with that a lot, even this year. I remember before senior year, I would always be comparing myself in academics. I would be like, ""Oh, this person's smarter than me"" and stuff like that, because I mean, CA is for really intelligent kids. And so the whole time I would just be like, damn, they have so many resources. They have tutors, they have all this, and I'm over here struggling in my room. My parents don't even know half of the things that I'm learning, they never learned any of this. That definitely stuck with me and I compared myself a lot to it. And also just a lot of people had friend groups and they had stable friendships that they've had since elementary or since preschool. And it made me miss the friends that I had outside of CA. I also compared myself a lot in the college process because damn, some people had two college counselors. They have one at CA, the one that everyone has, and they have one outside of CA, which is insane. Before I even got into college, I kind of was like, damn, I'm not going to be able to make it. All these people don't even have to worry about filling out FAFSA, they don't care about the cost, that's not their number one priority when it comes to college. And it's like they didn't have to apply to a bunch of scholarships and stuff like that. And that made me really compare myself to other people.",comp;suppot
,Olga,": And in middle school, I was always the smartest kid in my class, and coming to CA, it's like, well, now you're not. And so it was kind of difficult for me to not compare myself. How am I going to go from being one of the smartest in my class and then be one of just the regular people at CA? It was really hard. I was always asking for test scores like ""Oh, what did you get?"" I was kind of forcing myself to compare myself, but it was difficult for me not to because I wanted to see if I had even improved from what I did before.",comp;in
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like you compared yourself a lot to other POC?,comp
,Olga,": Not really. I feel like it wasn't really towards a lot of my POC friends. I also don't really compare myself to my friends, I feel like I compare myself to people that I don't even know. Maybe,I probably compared myself to a couple people. Someone who comes to mind* was because we came from similar aspects. They went to an elementary school, really close to mine, and then they got a scholarship I applied for that's meant for low income students. They also blended in really well with their white peers, which was kind of like, damn, why can't I blend in the same? Why are they more accepted than I am? But that was before. Someone else I think of, we came from the same school so I always compared myself to them. They have been here longer than I have. I mean, I think I've always compared myself to them academically, but it was definitely apparent this year. And I don't think I compare myself to anyone else besides that because I try not to. I think a lot of us were kind of on the same playing field, so it's like why am I going to compare myself if we're all struggling with comparison.",comp
,Yahaira,: Do you know anyone younger than you that has applied or will be applying to CA?,
,Olga,": My niece applied to CA this year and she got waitlisted, which is insane. It was just crazy when she was first applying, I was so scared. I was like, fuck, she's already kind of around white people a lot and she doesn't know Spanish, which concerns me. I mean, maybe that's just my mom talking in me, but it concerned me a lot. I wanted her to be very in touch with her roots and her culture. I'm the first one to go to private school in my family, but I didn't go for elementary school. I went for high school. I already had a backbone before CA. I had already experienced...",exp
,Yahaira,: Something else before private school.,exp
,Olga,": Yeah. I hadn't experienced a private school bubble. I had actually been exposed to real issues and people going through it. And so I was scared that my niece was going to be one of the preppy kids that's a part of that bubble. I don't know. I kind of was just thinking about the worst possible person that she could have become instead of what she could become positively. But I mean now it's not really an issue because she didn't get in, but it still worries me if she does go to a private school. It kind of concerns me because it's hard. I've seen people who have gone to private school their entire lives and see how they turned out, and it's scary for her to potentially see the same things that I'm seeing.",exp
,Yahaira,": Is it like when you first thought about her applying and getting in and going to CA, you didn't want to picture her becoming like the people that you were surrounded by?",
,Olga,": Yeah. I didn't want her to be ignorant. I didn't want her to just think that she has it easy, I guess. Obviously it's good, I don't want to see her struggle or anything. I don't want her to experience the same things that I experienced, but it's like at the rate that we're going, she's going to experience the same things that I'm going through, but she's going to be naive. She's not going to be like, ""Oh, well, I already know what it's like to not be in a PWI."" No. She's going to be like, ""That's my whole life."" And I want her to at least know that she has a support system somewhere else. My main support system freshman year was the people that I had outside of CA and that was the thing that kept me going. I was like, ""Okay, I might not have people in school, but at least I have people outside of school. I have a support system."" So it's like if she were to just go to a private school her entire life, the same one, I would've been like, it's wraps. She'll have no one, stuff like that. So that's why I got scared. I think it's the backbone part because public school made me experience many things. She just needs to experience something real. I saw my friends going through tougher things that I went through, like getting evicted or losing their home or not having enough money to eat or having food stamps and stuff. I saw people go through it, and I feel like that made me more empathetic towards the people around me. And at CA everyone is perfectly fine, most people are privileged, most people have a ginormous house or have even the basics, just being able to put food on the table. And a lot of people don't understand thats not what some people go through. They kind of don't understand that it...",exp;suppout
,Yahaira,": it makes you more aware of others, other than yourself.",exp
,Olga,: Yeah. And it's obviously not all people. I'm not saying that all people at CA are not aware of their financial circumstances or how privileged they are. But I do think that it's not the same to just acknowledge it. It's different once you experience it.,
,Yahaira,: How do you feel about the POC who have been at CA for a really long time? What would you say to them?,
,Olga,": I kind of just want to hear how it was. I feel like I've asked people before, ""Oh, how was CA in elementary school?"" And they would always be like, ""Oh, it sucked."" I'd be like, okay, well what did you do? In my mind, it's like, how did you balance that?",comp;exp
,Yahaira,": Yeah, you're only 10, how do you know how to do that?",comp
,Olga,": The cultural aspect is so different. How do you experience one culture at home and a different one at school. I never experienced that as a kid. I was always surrounded by Spanish speakers and I was always surrounded by people who were Latino in my class. So it was never much of a culture shock. But it's so weird to me, even with just my family, they know that I go to a PWI, they're like, ""Oh, you're whitewashed."" I could never imagine experiencing that at a young age. Like at five, six, or seven. I could never imagine being called whitewashed that young.",comp;exp
,Yahaira,: Yeah I question how you would make sense of it.,
,Olga,": Are people like ""Oh yeah, I am. I'm just going to stay like that."" or would you battle it? Like ""I want to be more involved with my culture."" I just wouldn't even know how to manage it. And so to them I'd probably be like, how was that balance? What did you do to focus on your culture? How did you even talk to your friends about it, if your friends were only white people? How did you even balance that?",
,Yahaira,": I feel like I agree with you though, that having the support system outside of CA definitely helped a lot. Like having a community and being friends with other Latino people and having another side outside of CA where I could be my authentic self. And even in the POD, the common ground that we all have is being POC at a PWI. But outside of CA being around POC that don't go to PWI's, it's so different. It's so different because it's like you don't have to talk about the struggles that you have to go through at PWIs. You just are immersed with each other and there's just another sense of relatability. And I think for me, it was extra hard when I lost that and extra hard when one of the people that was in that group was at my school because it was too different. We act completely different outside of this environment than when we're in it. We're in completely separate worlds inside this environment, but when it's outside of the environment, it's a different story.",aff;suppout
,Olga,": I forgot to mention that. It's different when you have POC friends in a PWI to when you have POC friends in a public school, because they're like, ""Oh yeah, it's probably hard to be around the white people haha."" But it's like, no, you don't get it. It's just so hard to even feel like you belong. It's even so hard to just speak Spanish in the halls or even just mess around the way that you would in general or stuff like that. It's not the same that I would act like in public school. It's so different.",belo
,Yahaira,": Do you feel like there was a lot of pressure being at CA, for you? There were just higher expectations than everybody else?",
,Olga,": Yeah. I feel like I had to try a little harder. I would always say something and it wouldn't come out how I wanted it to. I was always kind of expressive with my words, but then as soon as I came to CA, I felt stupid, so I didn't know how to articulate my words. It was really hard for me to even get adjusted to it. I don't even know how to speak my mind. So I feel like I had to try harder, prove that I was smart, or prove that I belong there for a reason. But it was just hard. It was like, damn, I have to try 10 times harder. I remember my freshman year math class, the first class, I was so lost. I didn't know any of it. I was like, how did people learn this? My middle school didn't prepare me at all. I studied way more than I probably needed to, but I didn't learn any of that the year before. It was hard also because with my POC friends that were at different schools, I would talk about how hard it was to get there academically and stuff, or how hard it would be to just do things, like write an essay or get a good grade. And then they would always be like, ""Well, you have the support there. It's better than public school."" They just wouldn't get it. And so it was hard to even tell them, ""Oh, well, I'm kind of struggling though."" I felt like I wasn't that smart. I didn't feel as smart as I used to be. They kind of downplayed it and felt like they were suffering more. So it was hard to even express my struggles with them. Like, damn, I'm over here struggling to even keep up with math class, and it feels like I have to be doing good to the people outside of CA. If not, what was it for? With my parents, it felt the same way. I never really wanted to show them that I struggled or that I failed at something. I wanted to prove to them that I belong there, that I was here for a reason, that I made the right choice.",respo;exp;in;belo;suppout
,Yahaira,: So do you feel like the support you had outside of school was only validating for your race? It wasn't more of validating the fact that you did struggle even at a private school.,
,Olga,": Yeah. I feel like it only really validated the race part because even with my cousins and stuff, I would be like, ""I'm struggling for real."" And then they would be like, ""Okay, you did this to yourself. And you have support. You should be grateful for having to experience these classes. I don't have to take a genetics class."" I think it was that aspect that now I have more privilege than them. At the end of the day, I do have privilege, I'm going to a private school. And it was really hard to balance that. It's like, dang, this is a newfound privilege that I've never had. Now it feels like I can't struggle. I feel bad, I know that they have it harder, but I didn't want to say anything. I don't want to say that you don't have it hard. Everyone has it hard, but I'm just struggling a lot with that. I didn't know how to come about my struggles without being ungrateful. It felt like I was being ungrateful, but I wasn't. I just wanted to voice how I was struggling.",suppout;exp
,Yahaira,: So did you ever find someone you were able to be open completely with about everything?,
,Olga,": At CA? Yeah, I think so. I am so grateful that I have a solid group of friends that I've surrounded myself with. Last year it was bigger because we had more people, but they don't go to CA anymore, they graduated. I feel like now I feel less supported because those people aren't there anymore. But I am definitely so grateful that I have three friends that I truly rely on and I can actually be honest with and I don't have to put a filter on at all. I feel like even with people outside of school, I have to put a little bit of a barrier just because I acknowledge that I go to a private school, but it's with the three friends that I do have I am very comfortable sharing all my experiences. We've gone through so much, I've been embarrassed, I've cried, I've experienced everything. So it's like at this point, what else? What else do I have to show? It's easier for me to just talk to those friends and I'm super grateful that I have them. I know a lot of people before, in different grades than me, didn't really feel supported in that. And so I am really grateful that I did find a group that I was able to connect with. I feel like numbers don't really matter.",suppin;exp
,Yahaira,: Quality over quantity.,
,Olga,: Yeah.,
,Yahaira,: Did you feel like you had an adult to talk about those things or no?,
,Olga,": Yeah, I think there was a switch this year because one of my teachers wasn't here. I feel like that was probably the main person that I went to a lot of the time. I think last year, and this year, made me realize that I have more support than I used to because sophomore year and freshman year, I was only exposed to teachers in the Upper School, not faculty in general. It was just mostly like ""Oh I have my Spanish teacher and, oh, my history teacher's kind of cool."" But I feel like after SDLC, it kind of made me realize that a lot of people and teachers understand. So I feel like the main people that I talk to now are in admissions, and then people in athletics. Even though I don't play any sports, it's crazy that I have a lot of support in the athletic department.",suppin
,Yahaira,: But who are those people? How come you connected with them even though they're not in the building that you're in the majority of your time?,suppin
,Olga,": I think it was just them acknowledging that we were struggling, acknowledging that CA has an issue. Or even just acknowledging that it's hard to just be yourself in a PWI. I think that's the main thing that drew me to them. They wanted to change something, even though it's obviously little steps, they just supported whatever I do, all my decisions. Even being proud of me when I get into a college or stuff like that. That's why I got close to them, was because they acknowledged me and they respect me as a student and a person. It's not just as a student to teacher connection, it's honestly just a connection.",suppin
,Yahaira,: Do you feel well prepared for life after CA?,
,Olga,": I think so. I feel like I already got through the PWI experience, I can low key make it through everything. And it's different at a private school, because if I went to a PWI public school, that's all just white people, I feel like it would've been different because it's white people from all social backgrounds. But now I feel prepared because I experienced the rich white people. I experienced the ones that live in 15 million dollar homes.",out;exp
,Yahaira,: You've experienced the people with the highest privilege.,out;exp
,Olga,": Exactly. So it's like I can experience whatever. I also feel like just being at PWI, thinking about college, I feel like it's going to be easier. Obviously there's more people with different backgrounds in college, so it's definitely going to be easier than going to public school with all Latinos and then going to college. I feel like I've heard that a lot. I've heard, ""Oh, it's such a culture shock once you go to college. It's just white people."" And I'm like, I've already experienced that, I already experienced the culture shock. I am already used to the culture shock. I feel ready, even if it is as bad as CA, I've already experienced CA. I don't think it can be any worse, to be honest.",out;exp
,Yahaira,: Are you excited to move on?,
,Olga,": Yeah. I feel like I'm also nervous. Just because I have built a community at CA. Even though it was hard to build a community and hard to find people that I feel comfortable with, I did find them at the end of the day, and so I think I'm just scared to leave the comfort that I've already built. I spent three years building it and getting used to it, and now I'm leaving it. So it's hard. I finally felt used to something and now it's like, damn, okay, hold on now, now I have to start over.",out;belo;suppin
,Yahaira,": So overall, do you feel like you belong at CA?",
,Olga,": Overall? I probably don't belong, but I feel like I do. I probably don't belong. I feel like it depends on the day. Sometimes I feel like I belong, sometimes I don't. But usually, I feel like I belong with certain people and then when I'm away from that group, I feel like I don't belong. Like with my friends, I belong. It's really weird, because I have to be around a specific group, if not I don't feel like I belong. Even in the lounge, if I'm just there with nobody around, I feel like I don't belong. I want to go home. I feel the same way I used to feel in freshman year, but then once I'm with my group, I feel fine, which is weird. So I feel like I belong and I don't belong.",belo
,Yahaira,": So you feel like freshman year, that was the peak time where you feel like you didn't belong?",belo
,Olga,": Yeah, definitely.",belo
,Yahaira,: Did you ever get imposter syndrome?,belo
,Olga,": Yes! Once I found out that imposter syndrome was a thing, I was like, that is me. That checks all the boxes, guys, I found a diagnosis. You have no idea, I was like  ""I literally don't belong. I think they made a mistake."" I felt maybe the let in the wrong person, that maybe they didn't want me for real. It was actually so bad because I felt like I wasn't smart enough. Again, that math class, I will always remember that math class, I was struggling so badly, or even just writing my first essay. And so for the longest time I was like, I don't belong. And I felt like this is the first year where I was finally okay. It was Senior year where I was like, ""Well, I'm already here. All these people around me have experienced the same high school that I have, and we made it."" This is my school experience, so it's fine.",belo
,Yahaira,": Do you feel like now you are not feeling imposter syndrome because you're already in college, you're already moving on?. It's not even about CA anymore, it's just the fact that you're done.",belo;out
,Olga,": Yeah. I think the imposter syndrome kind of went away like, I reached my dreams. So it's like what imposter syndrome was there if you actually did it. It was so bad freshman year, I was just like, there's no way that I'm supposed to be here. And I think it also made it worse that I didn't have a smooth transition at all. I didn't make a bunch of friends like I thought I would in the beginning, so it was hard. I wasn't experiencing it the way that I was seeing everyone else experience it. But I mean, I think after having gone through it and knowing that I'm going to go somewhere else and knowing that I got into all the colleges I truly wanted to get into, I feel like I did it.",belo;in
,Yahaira,: Was it worth it in the end?,
,Olga,": Yeah, I guess so. I'm going to say it's worth it. I did want to quit so much, and I feel like it was worth it in the sense that I didn't give up. I didn't give into being another POC that just gave up and left. I think in that way it was worth it because I actually did it. I didn't quit. I feel like it was worth it because now I made it easier for anyone else in my family to go to college or even my niece, even if she doesn't go to public school, if she wants to go to college, I have a legacy for her. I feel like it's just worth it in the sense that I left my mark and I made it known that I was at CA.",exp;respo
,Yahaira,: Would you recommend CA to other POC?,
,Olga,": No. No. I mean, I think it depends on what you want in a school. If you don't mind having a smaller friend group, or if you don't mind literally knowing every single person in your grade, I think you should do it. And I feel like if you're trying to be a first generation college student, I think it's worth it because it's like you do get a lot of more advantages out of it than you would at a public school. So I definitely recommend it, if you get money.",exp
,Yahaira,": You reccomend it, if you get money. You recommend it, if you experience something before you come here.",exp
,Olga,": Yeah. If you were literally thrown in there in elementary school, go somewhere else. I feel like I recommend it to people who definitely know that they're not going to get imposter syndrome or they know that they're well prepared for the school. I would not recommend it to someone who is just going because they heard from a white teacher that it was good.",exp;belo
,Yahaira,: And that was you.,exp
,Olga,": Yeah. So I wouldn't have recommended it to myself, but also I understand why it got recommended to me. So it's like if you have tough skin, then you can do it, but if you don't, don't go. It depends.",exp
