,Emilio,: I've been at CA since sixth grade. I'm a current senior.,
,Yahaira,: Tell me a little bit about yourself and what do you do? Who are you?,
,Emilio,: That's a great question.,
,Yahaira,: Just tell me a little bit about yourself.,
,Emilio,": Well, I grew up in Denver, a neighborhood called Westwood. I've played sports since I was young. I've always loved basketball, soccer, and anything creative really. I got into photography during high school year and I'm going to go to Boston for college next year.",
,Yahaira,": So you said you've been at CA since sixth grade? What is that, seven years?",
,Emilio,: Yeah seven years.,
,Yahaira,: What made you want to go to a private school?,motiv
,Emilio,": Honestly, it was because of my sister and brother. My parents wanted to put me somewhere where I can have a guaranteed chance at college or something after high school. So it was more about having good educational opportunities because my sister and brother went to CA before me and my sister went to a prestigious college on the east coast*. So they thought that was a good way to give me a better chance after high school.",motiv
,Yahaira,": Was CA your only option, was it the only school you applied to? That was where you were going to go?",
,Emilio,": Yeah, that was the only private school I applied to, and it also helped because my brother and sister went there and I had a better chance of going. I didn't apply to any other private schools because I didn't have any other connection to them.",
,Yahaira,": When your sister first applied, did your parents choose that for her? When did she start? ",
,Emilio,": Middle school. So actually it was a teacher at her elementary school*. She was really ahead of her class and [her teacher] was like, ""Yeah, she needs to go somewhere where she can actually grow and not be limited by opportunities."" So she recommended CA beacuse she knew some other kid went there, so they went to go visit and she actually applied for fifth grade, but they didn't have all the financial aid stuff. So then they applied the next year, and she got in.",
,Yahaira,": Do you feel like it was kind of a similar case for you? Like you were just ahead of your class as well, on top of the fact that your siblings went there and it was going to give you good opportunities after high school?",
,Emilio,": Yeah. I mean, most of elementary, I was mostly ahead of the class and my parents saw that and I think they were going to make me or not make me, but have me go to CA regardless.",
,Yahaira,": When you first attended CA, did you like it?",in
,Emilio,": When I first got there in sixth grade, honestly, I didn't like it that much. It was kind of weird. It was a new environment. It was weird making friends and trying to connect with different people, and it was also middle school, so there was like 65 kids and everyone already had their groups and everything, so it was kind of weird going in.",in
,Yahaira,": Would you say it was a harsh transition? I know your elementary school is predominantly Hispanic, so going into CA, what were some of, I don't know if you remember, but what are some of the feelings that you felt?",in
,Emilio,": I was really nervous on the first day, first week, honestly, the first couple of weeks were the hardest. After a while I got to know people, but it was definitely a weird transition. There was only three Hispanic kids. Me, one other person, and that might've been it.",in;exp
,Yahaira,: Just two of you.,exp
,Emilio,: It might've been just two of us.,exp
,Yahaira,: Was he one of your first friends?,exp
,Emilio,: Yeah.,exp
,Yahaira,: What drew you to be friends with him? Anything specific?,exp
,Emilio,": Well, actually I was his host.",exp
,Yahaira,": Oh, really?",exp
,Emilio,: Which was weird because I was a new kid.,exp
,Yahaira,": Yeah, I was going to say, usually hosts are someone who's already at CA.",exp
,Emilio,": It's almost always someone at CA, but because I had two siblings that already went there, they thought,""Alright, are you ready to host someone?"" Which I was annoyed about.",exp
,Yahaira,: I would've been annoyed too.,exp
,Emilio,": I mean, it worked out.",exp
,Yahaira,": Did you feel like you had, within your siblings, did they ever prepare you for anything?",
,Emilio,": Honestly, no. They kind of just let me go in and figure it out. They didn't have any big advice from me. They just said, ""You'll find a group of people that you like. School isn't, middle school's not going to be that hard.""",exp
,Yahaira,": Do you wish they had given you a little bit more, set you up for what it was going to be like?",
,Emilio,": Honestly, any advice they would've given me probably wouldn't have helped me at all. I was going to end up where I was supposed to be or be friends with who I'm supposed to be.",
,Yahaira,: Despite what they said.,
,Emilio,": Yeah, I think that's the whole reason they didn't give me advice. They didn't want me to go in and feel like I have to do something specific to fit in or something.",
,Yahaira,": So now as a senior and you're graduating and leaving in a couple months, do you feel like you've gotten what you wanted out of CA?",out
,Emilio,": I feel like on paper I have. The whole reason I went to CA was to go to college and hopefully be debt free when it comes to education. I feel like I accomplished that. And another secondary thing was meeting new people and just having connections that will last outside of high school. I feel like I've accomplished that. I feel like I've met friends that I know I can count on or be friends with outside of high school. And it's almost just been a good preparation for college. I feel like all the class rigor, having to talk to teachers or connect with teachers, they've given me a lot of things I can take into college, which I feel like that's what I was looking for mainly.",out;exp
,Yahaira,": Do you feel nervous at all going into a different school, having to meet new people? I know that you've been here for seven years at CA, and these people have known you for a really long time, so it's not going to be the same going into a new place.",out
,Emilio,": At first I was pretty nervous, but for the school I'm goint to the scholarship I got, it's like 15 kids and it's all first gen students. So last week I got to meet all the students, which was a lot more relieving, having people that share the same story as you, same background, same difficulties. So I feel like it'll make the transition easier for me knowing people, being able to branch out, and I'm also going a month early, so it's going to be a long orientation. We're going to do a bunch of events and activities. It's just kind of sad that I'm leaving a month early, but it'll make the transition easier.",out;aff
,Yahaira,": Do you ever feel like you had that same thing here at CA? Like having people, a space where you knew people of similar backgrounds and it would've just made it easier?",aff;exp
,Emilio,": Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of spaces you can go to and I already knew most people in the spaces, so I always talk to them and being really good friends with Javier, I always had someone to talk to if I ever had any issues about, I don't know, someone said this or...",aff;suppin
,Yahaira,: Situations specific to your experience with your race?,
,Emilio,: Yeah.,
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like you took advantage of those spaces?,
,Emilio,": I don't think I took as much advantage as I could have. I feel like I could have connected with more people and talked to more people in those spaces, and I don't know if, I wouldn't say I regret anything from high school, but I wish I would've done that differently.",aff;exp
,Yahaira,: What do you think that would've helped you with?,aff;exp
,Emilio,": Honestly, probably just connecting with more people. Probably meeting people with similar experience or just, I don't know, having common ground with different people.",aff;exp
,Yahaira,: Was there any reason why you didn't?,
,Emilio,: I can't pinpoint an exact reason. I feel like I already had a group of people that I would always hang out with.,
,Yahaira,": You had what you needed, you didn't need more?",
,Emilio,: Yeah. I don't know. I felt too comfortable in my group that I never felt the need to have to go to these spaces.,exp
,Yahaira,: But do you think in college that'll be different?,
,Emilio,": Yeah, I think so.",
,Yahaira,: You're going to try to seek that out?,
,Emilio,": Yeah. I feel like in college you look for people who have commonalities. I feel like that's where you're going to connect with the most. At CA, I had commonalities with most of my friends, but I already had a group of friends, I already had this group of people that I was with. I feel like it would be different in college too.",aff;out;suppin
,Yahaira,": If you could go back and do it again, would you still go to CA?",
,Emilio,": Yeah, I would. I honestly don't know where else I would go. I don't regret going here. I feel like I got what I wanted.",
,Yahaira,": I feel like sometimes when I think about it, I'm like, I couldn't picture myself anywhere else because I don't know what anything else feels like. I don't know what it would've been like to go to East or anything.",
,Emilio,": And I feel like going to East or Regis or Valor, those big schools, I feel like it'd be really easy to get lost or almost feel unmotivated in a way.",
,Yahaira,: Because you're one in so many?,
,Emilio,: There's so many people there.,
,Yahaira,: You don't feel like that's going to be you in college? I feel like you're going to a pretty big school.,
,Emilio,": Yeah, it's pretty big. It's like 15,000. I think it's different because I have resources and the scholarship has a base for where you can always come back and whenever you need help. But it'll probably be that way. There's probably going to be so many people that you meet and so many people that you're just not going to see either. I don't think I'm going to get lost there, or I hope not.",
,Yahaira,: What are some of your highlights from high school or just being at CA in general?,exp
,Emilio,": Being at CA? Probably the highlights is just all the people and memories that I've made with them. Even the small moments like lunch, playing basketball after lunch. It's small moments like that. I can say homecoming or prom, but it's probably the small moments I'm probably gonna remember the most.",exp
,Yahaira,: What about the things that you've struggled with? Some obstacles that you've had to face?,exp
,Emilio,": Well, it's probably a cliche answer, but Covid. It was annoying because it was my last year with my brother in high school and it would be back and forth on Zoom. It was less about school. I didn't find school hard at all freshman year. Zoom was pretty easy. But like missing out on a ton of firsts as a freshman, we didn't have homecoming, all the little freshman activities that we had, or meeting new people. I already had a group of friends, but a lot of people struggled going in and having to meet more people and it was just a lot harder.",exp
,Yahaira,": Yeah, fair. Do you feel well served being there at CA?",
,Emilio,": Well served? I would say so. Academically I feel well served. Like they've given me all I needed. Socially, I feel like I've been pretty well served. I've been pretty lucky with the group of friends that I've had and connecting with other people, but I feel like they've provided me with most things that I needed. I'd feel almost like bad having to ask for more.",suppin
,Yahaira,: Why do you feel bad asking for more?,suppin;exp
,Emilio,": I don't know. I feel like they have so much that I would feel almost ungrateful if I'm like, ""Oh, you didn't give me this or that."" I mean I feel like that in general for most things, which is I don't think it's a good thing to feel bad for asking for more, but I feel like they've given me everything that I've needed.",suppin;exp
,Yahaira,": What would be more though? In an ideal world or whatever, if you could ask for more and you didn't have to feel bad for it.",
,Emilio,": That's hard because I can't even think of what else I would've asked for. Nothing comes to my mind where I'm like, ""I would've wanted this. If they would've given me this, my experience would've been so much better.""",
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like CA is the perfect school. Was it the perfect place for you?,
,Emilio,": I mean now that I think about it. I would say diversity. If they would've given me more diverse school, then that probably would've made my experience better, but realistically it's not going to happen. There's going to be a handful of kids that come in every year. And having, in high school, people of all different backgrounds, it just makes your experience so much better. It's going to prepare you for the real world. Because you're not going to go to spaces where it's only white people. I mean you might, but it's not what it's going to be like wherever you go.",exp
,Yahaira,": I feel like a lot of people usually when they talk about CA they think of it as a bubble and everyone there is protected from the outside world, you're only focused on the people in the community. Do you feel like that's what that is, or do you feel like you were set up in the right way for what the real world's going to be?",
,Emilio,": I feel like the people here are really protected and I feel like a lot of kids here are only focused, or their parents make them focus on college. Everything you do here, whether you create a new club or have to get all A's, they all do it for college. A lot of them don't or aren't there for the experience or to connect with new people. I feel like they're just closed off and think, ""Oh, I have to succeed because blank, or because my parents went to blank."" I feel like it's a bubble in that sense. Kids are really shunned off from the real world, from real experiences. I don't know, I wouldn't call 'em ignorant, but I would say they're just really focused on themselves. I mean, that's not everyone. A lot of people are aware of what's going on, but I don't know. I feel like a lot of kids are closed off.",respo;exp
,Yahaira,: Do you feel like you are?,
,Emilio,": In a way, CA has kind of made me, I wouldn't say closed off from the real world, but kind of ignorant to how privileged I am to be at the school. Because there's a lot of kids that didn't have the same. Not that I had the greatest upbringing of all time, but CA has really made it easier for me to succeed. Some kids don't have the same chance as I do.",exp
,Yahaira,: Do you compare yourself often to other people?,comp
,Emilio,": I would say before, like in middle school, start of high school I used to, but in the end of my CA career I've just tried not to. There's no reason to, I have my own experiences and if I compare myself to these other people that have a lot more money or like... There's just no reason to compare yourself if it's just going to end up making you feel worse about yourself.",comp
,Yahaira,: So you don't compare yourself much to your white peers. What about the other students of color peers?,
,Emilio,": No. I mean our experiences are just so different and I've learned that if I compare myself to this person who has more than me right now, I'm just going to make myself feel worse about myself. It doesn't help anyone, comparing yourself to even your own peers.",
,Yahaira,": Do you ever feel outside of CA, any pressure from people your age that don't go to private school?",
,Emilio,: What kind of pressure?,
,Yahaira,": Maybe not pressure, but anything that has made you ever feel iffy that some other people have said? For example, for me outside of school, outside of the people from CA, my cousins and stuff are like, ""Oh, you're so whitewashed. You go to a private school."" Things like that.",
,Emilio,": I wouldn't say I would feel pressure. They wouldn't be like, ""Oh, you're so lucky you go to this private school."" It's more pressure that I put on myself. It's like, ""Oh, I go to this private school, I have to go to this great college. I have to do this. I have to do that. I have to be super smart and know everything."" So I wouldn't say I get pressured from friends outside of school like, ""Oh, you go to this white school."" I wouldn't say I get called whitewashed a lot, but I don't know. I think my family's made it so that I don't feel pressured to do these kinds of things. They've made me feel comfortable in taking my own path and even if I didn't want to go to college or community college, they are going to support me regardless. But it was mostly pressure that I put on myself to make it to this great college or to go outside of state.",respo;motiv;suppout
,Yahaira,: And where do you think that pressure comes from? Is that just like you're doing it for you or that pressure for yourself is coming from something else? Like you have to meet someone's expectations.,
,Emilio,": It sounds corny, but it's for my family. I know they went through all this so I could go to college and if I didn't go to college, I'm like, ""Wow, I really did all this just so I can, or they did all this just so I can mess around and not do anything with my life."" Not that you have to go to college to do something with your life, but...",respo;motiv
,Yahaira,: That's just what it feels like.,
,Emilio,": That's kind of what's been instilled in me. My brother and sister both went to college, so I was like, I'm the last one, I have to go. And they both went to the same private school, CA, so I was like, I kind of have to do this. No one really pressured me into having to do this, it was just kind like, oh, you're going to CA. I feel like the culture there is that everyone's going to college. So I feel like that's part of the pressure. Maybe all my friends saying, ""Oh, I'm applying to this college, and that college."" Maybe that subconsciously pressured me into wanting to go to college. Not that I've never not wanted to, but I feel like a lot of different factors pressured me into it.",respo;motiv
,Yahaira,: Do you ever think that you have to deal with more things than your peers at school?,
,Emilio,": Yeah, I would say it goes back to comparing myself to them. I try not to. I know I've gone through more than most of the kids and I don't know, it's weird...I know I've gone through more than most of the kids at CA, but I still try not to use that as a factor. I feel like I try not to feel bad for myself when it comes to these kinds of things. It might be a bad way of going about it, trying to internalize or not talk about these things, but I feel like I've had to go through more obstacles than the average CA student.",comp;respo
,Yahaira,": Do you feel like if you were to talk about it, it isn't about using it as an excuse, but more of just, I mean it's your reality, it's fair, it is what's going on in your life.",
,Emilio,": Yeah, I talked about it with my counselor, my advisor, and they're always asking me, ""Do you need extra help or anything?"" It's like a stereotype, but I'll be like, ""Oh, I don't need it. I'm doing just fine right now."" It's not like I keep it to myself, I talk to my family about it. I talk to close friends about it too, and I never see it as an excuse of me not doing well, but it's never affected my performance in school or anything. So I'm like, ""Oh, it's not affecting this. Or if I'm feeling fine then I don't have to ask for help."" Which is probably not the best way to go about it, but it's just like how I've dealt with it.",suppin
,Yahaira,: Have you ever experienced a microaggression at CA?,
,Emilio,": I can't pinpoint an exact microaggression. I've had people ask me ignorant questions, some things about home or speaking Spanish. There's a ton of tiny microaggressions that happen ever so often, but I haven't been called a slur at school. It's like a ton of small things, even about my name or just being ignorant about small things and they just don't know about it and if you don't call 'em out, then they're just not going to know if it's wrong or not. A lot of kids are ignorant to those kinds of things at CA.",exp
,Yahaira,: Do you call them out?,exp
,Emilio,": Usually. I would say when it's people I'm comfortable with, I usually tell 'em about it, like ""Yeah, I don't like that"" or ""You shouldn't say that."" It's mostly not just about me, but for them going into the real world outside of CA, they're going to figure out that you just can't say a lot of things.",exp;respo
,Yahaira,: Did you ever hear about other people experiencing things that are more serious?,
,Emilio,": I can't think of an exact example. At CA, I just haven't heard. I bet there's a lot of instances of people facing a lot worse microaggressions than me, but I just haven't heard of them or I feel like they're just not talked about if they do happen, they kind of just shun it out.",exp
,Yahaira,: Do you mean CA shuns it out?,exp
,Emilio,: They just don't talk about it.,exp
,Yahaira,: Why do you think that is?,exp
,Emilio,": They want to keep this perfect image like, ""Oh, everyone here feels super included. No one ever has to face any backlash for their race or ethnicity or different background that they have."" So it's just about keeping up an image and making sure that they think or that they keep this idea that everyone feels included and safe, which is not the case for a lot of kids.",exp;belo
,Yahaira,": I asked this a little bit earlier in a different way, but if you were to do it again, let's say you're back in sixth grade knowing everything you know now, what is something that you'd like to have been already changed so that you didn't have to experience it?",in
,Emilio,": Well, in middle school there's absolutely zero spaces that you could go to. I bet there is now, but there was no affinity groups or anything you would go to. I feel like that's something I would change. Or when you first go into CA, having adults, specific adults that you can talk to, not even just your core advisor, but someone that maybe shares the same experiences as you that you can talk to because a lot of kids that go in probably don't have older siblings or younger siblings that they can share or talk these problems through. I can't think of any other concrete things I would change. I feel like I already talked about diversity, but I just don't see that as a realistic change at CA.",in;aff;suppin;reps
,Yahaira,: Why?,
,Emilio,": It's just the financials. I feel like that's always been a big barrier. No matter how much money they get, there's always going to be something else. I mean a lot of these parents pay their way into CA and the reality is just a lot of minorities just can't do that. There's no way they can donate all this money to get into CA. Or even kids growing up in lower income areas, maybe they don't take the same classes or have the same opportunities to get ahead, so when they're taking the tests or all the entrance exams, they might not be as prepared as some white kid that's had tutoring since they were in first grade. There's a lot of differences or inequalities that have to be broken through for that to happen.",exp
,Yahaira,": During high school and during middle school and stuff, do you feel like you had enough support outside of the CA community?",suppout
,Emilio,": Yeah, and I feel like I was lucky having a sister and brother that both went through the same things as I did, so if I felt lonely at school, I could talk to them and be like, ""Oh, what should I do? What can I do about this quiz coming up or test?"" And my parents were always supportive. So I feel like my family, I got really lucky having a good family that I can fall back on or talk to or just talk any issues through.",suppout
,Yahaira,: What about with the organization you're a part of*?,suppout
,Emilio,": Yeah, I haven't mentioned it yet actually. That's another big aspect of it. I probably wouldn't have gotten into or been as prepared going into CA if it wasn't for them and having that other group that I can fall back on is another big aspect. Even mentoring all throughout high school. Both of my mentors went to CA also, so they also talked me through a lot of things like tests or even the college process. And having friends there was also a big help.",suppout
,Yahaira,": Why don't you think you have mentioned it yet, if you think about it?",
,Emilio,": I would say none of the questions have been directed towards it. I mean, it is a big thing I've talked about in most of my college essays and all of my interviews. I honestly kind of blended the organization and CA. Not that they're the same community, they're completely different, but having it be on the same campus, it's always felt kind of together. I dunno how to explain it.",
,Yahaira,": That's fair. If you didn't have the organization in high school or middle school, how do you feel like that would've changed your experience?",
,Emilio,": I feel like it would've made the transition a lot harder. Also, being at CA for my time in the organization, I felt already comfortable in the space. I knew where everything was, even how to open a locker, the small things, I feel like that prepared me. And also having my brother and sister there, it also prepared me. It also just made the space more comfortable going into CA. It helped me academically, but it was mostly a social thing. Me going there every year, I didn't really care about learning new things.",suppout;in
,Yahaira,": When you started at CA in middle school, did you feel like it was harder academically?",
,Emilio,": I feel like they made it an easy transition. It was probably hard for the first week because it was a different classroom environment, like everyone there is super smart. I didn't feel imposter syndrome, I didn't know what that was in sixth grade. I didn't feel that when I first got there. I feel like I can't really remember a lot of sixth grade to be honest with you. I don't remember struggling, like having to seek help for academics.",in
,Yahaira,: Did you ever feel imposter syndrome?,
,Emilio,: I can't pinpoint feeling imposter syndrome.,
,Yahaira,: Do you feel overall that you belong at CA?,belo
,Emilio,": That's a tough question. I've never felt like I don't belong. I feel I've felt like I've belonged and it's probably been a harder path towards feeling that way than most kids, but I've never been excluded or made to feel like I don't belong, so I would say I feel like I belong at CA.",belo
,Yahaira,: Was there ever a time you didn't feel like you belonged?,belo
,Emilio,": I would say the first few weeks at CA, in sixth grade, but after a while I figured I belong. Even socially, I've never had too many issues, never felt excluded. Academically I felt like I belonged.",belo
,Yahaira,: Did you ever question leaving?,belo
,Emilio,": I never saw it as an option. Maybe I thought I'd be happier at some other school, but I never questioned leaving. I was always going to see it through no matter what. ",belo
,Yahaira,": What about, I guess this kind of falls a little bit to the imposter syndrome, but did you ever question yourself in general?",
,Emilio,": Maybe in high school, everyone being so focused on college that I would question, can I get into this college? Do I have the same resume as this kid? It goes back to comparing yourself, but a lot of kids maybe have really good extracurriculars or grades and I was like, do I think I can get into this college? Do I have the same things as this kid has? That's probably the only time I've questioned that.",comp
,Yahaira,: Are you excited to move on?,
,Emilio,": From CA? Yeah, I'm excited. It's been a good seven years, but having something different is definitely going to be a lot better and probably better for me as a person too.",out
,Yahaira,: Why do you think that as a person?,
,Emilio,": I feel like if I stayed at a school like this going into college, I just would not grow at all. I just wouldn't learn, not in the academic sense, but experiences. A lot of life's learning through experience and CA is going to give you structured experience, they're going to put you in these situations. But not until you go to a real environment, not that CA's not a real environment, but a real world environment, you're not going to really grow and learn a lot as a person.",out;exp
,Yahaira,": What would you say to the people who have been there way longer, like lower school? Lifers. Super lifers. Do you feel like they haven't experienced much?",
,Emilio,": Honestly, no. I know people who've been there for a while and even they say, ""Yeah, I've totally been shut off. I need to get out of here."" A lot of them, I wouldn't say regret being there for so long, but they're like, ""Damn, I've been here for 13 years. There's so much that I've probably missed out on."" And I feel like a lot of 'em feel almost tired of it being at the same school for 13 years and probably being with the same people for a lot of the time there. Not that they've not gone through anything, but it really shuts 'em off from a lot of experiences.",exp
,Yahaira,: What about other students of color who have been there for thirteen years.,
,Emilio,": I wouldn't say I feel bad for them, but I would just say I would find it hard to be at CA for so long. It sounds bad to say I don't feel bad. I don't know how to explain it. They might've had a good experience at CA, I don't know.",exp
,Yahaira,": Maybe it's not that you necessarily feel bad, but it's almost like if it were you,",exp
,Emilio,": Then I'd be like, damn. Yeah, I probably wouldn't want that.",exp
,Yahaira,: You're grateful for the experiences you've had before CA?,exp
,Emilio,": Yeah. I had good experiences at my elementary school and I met people that I still talk to, and all the teachers I had there I feel like they had a positive impact on me. Not that I want to be the same student I was, because I feel like looking back, I could probably go to a different school and maybe have a good experience, but I'm grateful for the time I had before CA.",exp
,Yahaira,: Do you think going to CA for middle school is way different than starting in high school?,
,Emilio,": Yeah, I feel like it's a lot different.",
,Yahaira,: What about it?,
,Emilio,": Like having more people. I think middle school's 60-65 kids. 35 new kids in high school, and also you have other grades sophomores, juniors, seniors, so there's a lot more people to connect with and I feel like there's more spaces you can go to. It's just bigger overall, which I think is a good thing. In middle school, it was a weird start, especially transitioning, you're going through puberty, which is also weird. And high school you just, everyone's trying to figure out who they are too.",in;exp
,Yahaira,": What about for people who went to high school, do you think it was, you talked about the positives because it's bigger, you have more people to connect with, but what about it being hard? Do you think it can be harder?",in;exp
,Emilio,": It probably is harder because throughout middle school there's already friend groups of people. They already know each other and going in as a new student, I bet it's a lot harder going into high school. There's positives like there's more people you can meet, but that doesn't make it easier at all. I mean, in high school, you actually have to focus on academics, grades don't matter in middle school realistically, and you have to balance all this social academic stuff.",in;exp
